INSTALL ($Id$)
=======

Right now, setting up the chaos system is not very easy. We are well
aware of this, but we have been forced to oversee it for now -- if the
code does not work, it is not of much use to be able to install it.

Still, you should be able to do something like this:

	make configure
        make install

(This will copy the compiled libraries to some different directories
under the path you've chosen as prefix)

Well, that should be it. If everything works out fine, you should be
able to link chaos programs to those libraries. We hope to make the
process of setting up chaos a lot easier in the future. For now, happy
hacking!
