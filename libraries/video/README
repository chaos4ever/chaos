The basic concepts of the chaos graphics library are portability and
modularity. If a program is written for the chaos graphics library it
should run on any platform. Even thoose without graphics hardware.

The chaos graphics library defines 3 native types. The native types
represents a "standard" format for images, colors and color channels. In
the time of writing 32-bit (w/ alpha channel) seemce to be "more than
anyone possibly could want" (Bill Gates, 1981). So I made it the standard
color type. Additionally every native color has it's own luminance value
whitch can be usefull for 1 channel video modes.

The basic and bottom type is the native_channel_t, currently it's just an
unsigned 8-bit. After that comes the native_color_t. Whitch is constructed
by native_channel_t (one for red, green, blue, alpha and luminance).

Images are described by the native_image_t.

Native types are only to exist in initialization of an application and
should always be converted to local types to avoid low performance and
unsessary memory usage.

Local types are local to each graphics library extender and MUST only be
used that way.

The region type defines a surface somewhere (probably in primary buffer)
and are only for copying and filling very fast. The region functions
are good examples of functions that could be hardware accelerated with
most "modern" graphics adapters (like mach64, mga or NV)

Some example code:

(Put pixel on screen)

native_color_t myNativeColor;
local_color_t  myLocalColor;

graphics_start (320, 200, 8, TRUE);
graphics_rgba  (128, 50, 32, 255, &myNativeColor);
graphics_color_native_local(myNativeColor, &myLocalColor);
graphics_pixel_put (graphics_width / 2, graphics_height / 2, myLocalColor);

(Copy region on screen)

region_t myRegionDest = { 100, 100, 150, 150 };
region_t myRegionSrc  = { 130, 130, 180, 180 };

graphics_region_copy (myRegionDest, myRegionSrc);
