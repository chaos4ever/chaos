This is the chaos libraries. They are required to compile the servers,
and eventually to compile virtually any chaos program.

They are *not* licensed under the GPL, but under the Lesser General
Public License (LGPL), since we want people to be able to write
non-GPL:ed free software for chaos (for example, BSD-licensed
programs). This also makes it possible to develop proprietary software
for chaos, which we do not encourage people to do, but nevertheless
accept *if* they choose to do so. Please see the file COPYING for more
information about this.

(You can read more about the licensing of chaos on
