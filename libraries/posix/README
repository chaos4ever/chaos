This is the POSIX compatible library. The idea is to be 100%
compatible, if possible (Of course, this is difficult due to the
differences between the POSIX and chaos designs).

Note that no ISO, BSD or SysV functions are to be put here. They are
in separate libraries (well, right now, that's only true for ISO, but
you're very well welcome to write a BSD and a SysV emulation library
if you feel so inclined).

One file per function is reasonable in most cases, but if there are
several similar ones, they can be put into separate files.

Please note that this library is provided for COMPATIBILITY PURPOSES
ONLY. NO DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CHAOS PROGRAMS SHOULD USE THIS
LIBRARY. This can not really be emphasized enough -- we treat this a a
deprecated library. A lot of bugs are inherent to the lack of good
design, so please don't try to fix things. Of course, there may be
bugs in our design (but they should be few; much of this is borrowed
from other, well-tested systems).
