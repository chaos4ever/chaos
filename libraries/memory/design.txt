Abstract: Memory library design overview.
Author: Anders Ohrt <doa@chaosdev.org>

All pages reside in a global heap, and are handed out by the kernel.

The memory library uses the slab memory allocation system, extended
with the hoard system. Each cluster of threads share a 'heap'
containing one or more 'superblock'. Each superblock contains buffers
which are what is handed out to the threads.

Each heap has a double linked list of superblocks. One list per
buffersize in the superblock. The list is ordered in order of
fullness, with full superblocks first and empty lists at the end.
