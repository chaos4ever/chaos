    <para>
      Welcome. This is autochaos, the building tool for chaos. If you
      have been using GNU autoconf/automake, you might think you know
      pretty well what this is about, but think again -- you are most
      certainly mistaken. autochaos has almost <emph>entirely</emph>
      different goals than those of the GNU tools, in a similar way
      that chaos strives to do something pretty different from GNU.

      The first thing you are likely to run into is the ability to
      configure the system. They are rather minimal -- unlike
      autoconf/automake, which supports almost anything, we have tried
      to keep autochaos minimalistic and clean. It is almost
      <emph>only</emph> suitable when developing stuff for the chaos
      operating system. If you have any nice ideas about how to make
      this suitable for multi-platform things too, without breaking
      the cleanness in the design, please contact us.

    <para>
      Each autochaos package must have an autochaos.rules file. It is
      what basically defines what the package is composed of. It is,
      like most everything in chaos is, or will be, a standard XML
      file. It can look like this:
