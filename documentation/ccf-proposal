  proposal for the chaos configuration utility
  copyright 1999 chaos development
-----------------------------------


the chaos configuration utility shall be used by every program running under
chaos and is dependant on a configuration file. each program has to supply it's
own template file. the chaos configuration utility uses this file to present
to the user, a friendly, graphical interface to set and change the
configuration of the program. the program may supply a configuration file as
well, but that will not be neccessary as it can easily be created from the
template file. every program-package MUST create a
/config/<program_name>/template file. the configuration utility checks on
startup all the directories in the /config directory and presents the found
directories to the user to choose from, unless program-name was given as a
parameter. after this step, the configuration program reads the template file
and creates all the menus, buttons and textboxes needed.


  the template format and datatypes
-------------------------------------


the main template-skeleton is built up by sections like this:

section ("card settings")
{
  /* stuff here */
}

section ("ethernet firewalling")
{
  /* more stuff here */
}

the user first has to choose a section to edit. this is to add overview to the
configuration files and categorize all the options for the user. the program
stores two files, when using this template; card_settings and
ethernet_firewalling. they are both located in /config/<program_name>

each section is then built up by various datatypes with names and possible
values:

section ("card settings")
{
  integer io (0x280 to 0x360 step 0x10);
  integer irq (3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13);
  check mac_assigned ("assign static ethernet address")
  {
    integer mac (0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF);
  }
  select connection_type ("10baseT", "10Base2", "100baseTX");
  text my_story ("write about your life, pal");
}

section ("ethernet firewalling")
{
  check ethernet_firewalling ("enable ethernet-level firewalling")
  {
    group policy
    {
      select type ("reject", "deny")
      {
        case ("reject")
        {
          integer mac (0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF);
          choice log;
          textbox return_text ("send this text in the icmp-reject package");
        }
        case ("deny")
        {
          integer mac (0 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF);
          choice log;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

in this example, in the first section (card settings) you will have nine io
addresses to choose from from a listbox, and similar with the irq. there will
also be a checkbox (which can either be "on" or "off") and if it is checked/on,
you will be able to fill in a textbox to assign a mac-address. this checkbox
will only accept numbers between 0 and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF. there will be a textbox
for you to write about yourself too. this text has no limitations and can
contain almost anything. the following is an example of a configuration file
generated from this template:

section ("card settings")
{
  io = 0x300;
  irq = 10;
  mac_assigned = TRUE;
  mac = 0x4f035b8cd934;
  connection_type = "10baseT";
  my_story = "i was born, then i became l33t and finally i became a quaker...";
}

section ("ethernet firewalling")
{
  ethernet_firewalling = TRUE;
  policy
  {
    type = "reject";
    mac = 0x0472bd9c45ff;
    log = FALSE;
  }
  policy
  {
    type = "reject";
    mac = 0xfbc67d8200b0;
    log = TRUE;
  }
  policy
  {
    type = "deny";
    mac = 0x9c667bd3f67d;
    log = FALSE;
    return_text = "du suger!";
  }
}

more datatypes will be added as there are needs for them...
