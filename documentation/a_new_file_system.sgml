<title>Differences vs. present-day file systems</title>

<para>
Present-day file systems are stone-age systems, developed and
introduced with Unix, that have served their purpose well for a long
time, but need to be replaced with a new file system that possesses a
certain number of advantages.
</para>

<para>
Some of the design issues where this new file system differs compared
to the old one are these:
</para>

<para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
File extensions are replaced with object type
ID's. Microsoft Word documents are no longer identified by their .doc
ending, but rather with a unique type ID.  Applications registers as
type ID handlers.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The differences between files and directories are
skipped. These old concepts are replaced with objects. Objects can
contain data, and can also be a container of other objects.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Applications are self-contained objects that register and
unregister automatically in a computer system.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
A hierarchical attribute structure can be applied to
objects, allowing an efficient document storage and retrieval
system.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Each of the differences is explained in detail below.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Object type ID:s</title>

<para>
The file extension is skipped. They can be retained if desired to, but
have no system-wide meaning. Applications or executables are no longer
marked .exe or with a +x attribute, but rather with an application
object type which the system knows and treats like
executables. Documents are identified by their type ID as well;
applications become handlers of the type ID:s. Whenever a user wished
to interact with a document, the system starts the registered document
handler knonw by its type ID.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Objects and containers</title>

<para>
Instead of having a sharp distinction between directories and files,
they are both merged into the concept of objects. Objects contain
data, other objects, or a combination of both. They can represent
directories, and they can represent files as well. A directory becomes
an object with no internal data - a "pure container". A file becomes
an object that contains no other objects. There can also be
combinations, where a file contains both internal data and other
objects as well.
</para>

<para>
This can be illustrated by the following practical examples.
</para>

<para>
A user creates a directory called "Documents". He sees the directory
as any old operating system would represent it; but behind the scenes,
what happens is that an object is created with a special type ID
recognized by the system, called Folder. The system is the handler for
objects of that type, and knows that folders should not contain any
data in themselves; they are pure containers and only contain other
objects. Should the system desire so, however, it will be able to
place internal data in the object. This allows the system with a
convenient place to store folder-specific information, like
appearance, sorting, icons etc.
</para>

<para>
In this Document folder, he creates a Microsoft Word document. He sees
it as a plain old document, but the system has behind the scenes
created yet another document, this time with the Microsoft Word
Document type ID. This object, like any other object, has the
capability to contain both data and other objects. It has, therefore,
the functionality of both a file and a directory. When the user
double-clicks on the file, Microsoft Word, which is the registered
document handler, fires up and displays the document on the
screen. When the user subsequentyl writes text into the document, it
is stored inside the internal object data. If the user at this time
wished to drag-and-rop an Excel sheet into the document, the Word
application would do that happily without any thought about it. Behind
the scenes, the object would start acting like a directory as well,
placing either the Excel sheet within the Word object, or a link to
the Excel sheet, much like you would have placed that document/link
inside a directory. You would therefore be able to take that object,
embedded in the Word document, and from the file system viewer itself
remove it from the Word document and place it as a self-contained
sheet in the Documents folder without any problem whatsoever.
</para>

<para>
Let's also look at the concept of an application. An application is
also an object, completely self-contained, in that all its dependent
"files" reside inside the application as sub-objects. Therefore, it is
extremely easy to move an application from one place to another; all
that the user would have to do is to move the object to a new
location. The executable code is stored within the object itself; it's
needed files are stored as embedded objects in that container. Shared
files, like Dynamic Link Libraries, or Shared Libraries, can be
represented as links inside of the application object. Instead of
storing a library as an embedded object file (still fully visible with
the file system viewer), it could store a link to the library. This
would allow th euser in no time to decide wether all the required
libraries were installed on his computer or not. The user would also,
if such functionality were to be built into the system, be able to
replace a library inside an application, embedded or linked
(i.e. static versus shared), at will, and would be able to make an
application fully self-contained without shared libraries at all.
</para>

<para>
It is worth noting that links in this content should be a special
case; not objects, but pointer to objects, much like symbolic links in
Unix They should be freely movable, and should be able to point to
nonexisting objects - required in the case where an application
contains a link to a shared library and the library does not exist;
but if the user installs the library the link should automatically
work, since both the library is installed, and the link points to a
predefined location.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Self-registering applications</title>

<para>
The operating system should know automatically which applications are
installed and thus automatically determine the relationship between
applications and document ID:s. Suppose, for instance, that a user has
an object of the Microsoft Project[1] type, but unfortunately, he
doesn't have Microsoft Project installed.  He knows, however, that his
co-worker's computer at the office has Microsoft Project installed. At
this point, this analogy starts breeaking copyright laws, but let's
ignore that for the sake for the argument, and if you see any BSA
agents, please warn me quickly. He goes into his friend's computer,
and drags the Microsoft Project application object over to his
Applications folder. As soon as it is copied, the operating system
realizes that it is, indeed, an application object, and since the
Applications folder is a place where the system knows active
applications are stored (this functionaly could be built into the
Applications folder object's type handler), the system scans the
Microsoft Project application object and automatically registers it as
an object type handler for the type ID:s found in the application. The
user can now, without any further action, use his Microsoft Project
document object by double-clicking on it. When the BSA sues the
company a few days later, the system administrator drags the Microsoft
Project application object into the trashbin, and the operating system
automatically removes Microsoft Project as the type ID handler for the
previously installed type ID:s.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Hierarchical attribute lists</title>

<para>
The normal organization of user documents into directories function
well, but is sometimes not good enough. The ability to assign a number
of organizational attributes to a document enables the user to quickly
store a document and just as quickly locate it a again.
</para>

<para>
Let's suppose that the user has a very important document that is
related to a meeting about a project called "Internet Banking". He
wishes the document to possess the two attributes Internet Banking and
Very Important. He couldn't store it in a directory called important
because it belongs to the Internet Banking project; likewise, he
couldn't just store it without cretain problems in a directory named
after the project; because how would he know that that particular
document was very important? If he wanted a list over very important
documents, he'd have to go through the entire file system and review
every document to know it's importance. and what if he simply wanted a
list over every document that was business-related? All those
questions rely hevaily on the organization of the directories
involved; if the directory structure is insufficient, it has to be
remade later on, with all the hassle it might produce. If the
situation evolves to include multiple users, the problems have only
begun.
</para>

<para>
The assignment of attributes solves this. Individual files can be
marked with certain attributes, in order to let the system search for
them and find them efficiently. The attribbutes themselves would be
organized hierarchically; that is, the attribute Internet Bankning
would be located as a sub-attribute of the more general attribute
Projects, or Business. A simple search for, say, Business, would then
reveal all documents marked with the attribute Business, or any of
it's sub-attributes, for instance Internet Banking. The search could
of course be expaneded; the user might want to search for all Word
document written in the last five days, that belong to any of the
business-related projects, except all documents of low importance or
documents written by Todd, a person at the office which everybody
hates.
</para>

<title>Additional features...</title>

<para>
There is much to be said about additional features, like roaming
profiles over networks, private user viewspace, collaboration issues
with attribute trees and access control lists on all levels. But we
leave those as an excercise to the reader.
</para>

<para>
[1] At this point I must comment on all the Microsoft objects so
far. I am not endorsing Microsoft products, nor will I ever do so, I'm
just noticing that there are a lot of Microsoft docuemtns around and I
figure that they are the most likely document object to be dealt with.
