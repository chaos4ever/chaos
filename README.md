[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chaos4ever/chaos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chaos4ever/chaos)

Welcome to chaos. chaos is an operating system developed around the year 2000 for the x86 platform (also referred to as "ia32" in the codebase). It contains working protected mode/virtual memory initialization, processes and threads, interrupt support, PCI, text-based VGA and a simple IPv4 stack (supporting UDP, ARP and ICMP). Naturally, given the hobbyist nature of the project, none of the features we just mentioned is "complete" in the sense that it supports all features of the PCI bus, or all features of UDP, ICMP etc. Nonetheless, the system was at an earlier point stable to the point where it possible to e.g. use it for network bridging - you could run e.g. ssh "through" a machine running chaos. It would also reply to ICMP echo (i.e. "ping") packets, as well as support outgoing ping packets to other machines.

Having that said, there are a number of issues with the codebase which made us start the development of the new [stormG3](https://github.com/chaos4ever/stormG3) kernel (which would replace the existing storm "G1" kernel. There was also a [stormG2](https://github.com/chaos4ever/stormG2) project being undertaken but it was abandoned before being completed). The most critical issue with stormG1 is that the kernel leaks memory; the number of free pages decrease gradually over time. Because of this and the general feeling that the system would benefit from a major refactoring (hey, isn't it always fun to rewrite your code, trying to get things better done the second time? :wink:) the storm G3 project was initiated, where we attempted to Do Things Right&trade; to a greater point than had been earlier done. Like many hobby/spare-time projects, the project was never finished and storm G3 is therefore currently in a very unfinished state. Nonetheless, feel free to check it out if you like.

## Compiling chaos

### Prerequisites:

- Linux, Mac OSX or Windows.
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). If you don't know what this is, go check out their web page. It makes things like this much easier and smoother.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- If Windows: an `ssh` client. (Install [mingw-get](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/getting_started) and then select at least the `msys-openssh`, `msys-base` and `msys-bash` packages.)

### Setting up the dev environment

* Fork the repo (using the Fork button in the upper right).
* Clone your fork (using the clone button here at GitHub or straight in the command line).

#### On Linux or Mac

* Open a terminal program.
* Change working directory to your working copy (`cd ~/git/chaos` or similar)
* Run the following commands:

        vagrant up
        vagrant ssh

#### On Windows

* Launch `msys.bat` from the MSYS packages, as Administrator. **Note**: You *must* run `msys.bat` as Administrator. This is because symbolic links with VirtualBox is only supported when the VM is launched as an Administrator, and the `chaos` build process relies on symbolic links. Typical errors you can get if you do not do this right is "Protocol error" and similar. If this happens, do a `vagrant halt` and then retry the commands below in an admin `msys.bat` instead.)
* Change working directory to your working copy (`cd /c/git/chaos`, assuming that you have the code in `c:\git\chaos`) and run the following commands:

        vagrant up
        vagrant ssh

### Compiling:

    rake
    rake install

(Not all parts of the system has been converted to the `rake`-based compilation process yet, but we're working on it. Feel free to send a patch/pull request if you add support for building some of the broken parts of the system.)

This should create a `chaos.iso`, if all worked correctly. Congratulations! You're just one step away from having a fully working version of chaos running now. :)

### Running the compiled result.

* Fire up your favorite VM software (VirtualBox, Parallels, VMware Player/Fusion, etc. Even Virtual PC will probably do). If you're lazy, just run `./qemu.sh` within the Vagrant-VM; it will run `qemu` inside VirtualBox, which is enough for many test scenarios.
* Create a tiny VM (256 megs of RAM will do, no hard drive etc) with the `chaos.iso` file you just built as the CD drive.
* Launch it. If all went well, you shhould get an image like this:

![chaos running in Parallels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaos4ever/chaos/master/misc/chaos-in-parallels.png)

That's all there is to it, *for now*. There's lot of stuff more that "used to work" at some point, but for whatever reason (new gcc versions being introduced, code being unmaintained for many years and then suddenly refactored/cleaned up in some areas) most of what "used to be", like our nice shell, IP stack etc is not (yet!) working again. Want to help us out? Fork the project and start hacking away! :smile:

## License

### General

(The license we use is commonly known as the BSD license, without advertising clause (also known as "3-clause"). Some  subdirectories in this directory may still contain references to the GPL since this is the license we used previously. However, the code can now be used under the BSD license - to the best of our knowledge, all major copyright holders have agreed to this license change. If you hold the copyright to some of the code herein and are in disagreement to this, please notify us immediately and we will work something out.)

The code in the following directories/files are to be treated as licensed under the [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) since they are derivates of code from the Linux kernel:

* [libraries/string/inlines.h](libraries/string/inlines.h) (should be fixed).
* servers/system/pci
* servers/network/3c509
* servers/network/ne2000
* [storm/ia32/cpuid.c](storm/ia32/cpuid.c) (should be rewritten so the whole kernel can be used under the BSD license).

We encourage code that is written for chaos (servers, programs, libraries) to use the license below. This license allows us, and anyone else for that matter, to use your code freely, incorporate it in future versions of chaos and similar. However, unlike with the GNU GPL, we don't force this choice upon you. The freedom is yours. Use it wisely.
