	* pci.c: Fixed a bug which made the code disable the ISA bridge in
	some way... or something. It didn't work anyway, but now it does. :)

	* Basically rewrote the PCI server from scratch, to support
	multiple PCI buses (and thus AGP).

	* pci.c: Fixed an american typo. Started working on making this
	server something more than something to just print out a nice list
	of available devices...

	* Rewrote to not use as many system_call functions directly, but
	instead go via wrappers.

	* Started writing this change log.
