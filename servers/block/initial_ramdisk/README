The initial ramdisk server is used to create a startup drive, on which
the hard drive server and such things can be located. Also, it makes
changing your root partition at run-time much easier -- just tell the
system that //ramdisk should be mapped to /, and off you go.

To get or put files to the ramdisk image, the best way is (IMO) to use
mtools. It is readily available on most Linux distributions. Add a
line like this to your mtools.conf:

drive u: file="/home/luke/chaos/servers/initial_ramdisk/ramdisk.image" tracks=80 sectors=18 heads=2 mformat_only

...and you will be able to access this device as u: with all the mtools.
