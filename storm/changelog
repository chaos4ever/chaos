2000-09-07  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* include/storm/kernelfs.h: New class KERNELFS_CLASS_TIME_READ.

	actually used from thread_control...

2000-08-17  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory.c (memory_deallocate): Changed this function to take
	a double pointer argument instead of a page number.

2000-08-14  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/thread.c (thread_create): Made the function create unique
	copies of the lowest page table, so that threads are a little more

	little earlier if the input data is bad.

	* generic/mailbox.c (mailbox_receive): Re-added the check for the
	thread ID, so that you can not do a receive on someone else's
	mailbox. The reason I commented it out was a long story, but it
	should really be there, due to several causes.

2000-07-28  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* makefile.template: Added an $Id: changelog,v 1.17 2000/07/30

	the current-arch link if it exists, to avoid creating a link to

	If)

2000-07-23  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

2000-07-22  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* include/storm/return_values.h: Removed the stupid error codes I

	port_free_all function.

2000-07-18  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory.c: Fixed memory allocation for processes. Yahoo!

2000-07-17  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

2000-07-10  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory_global.c: Started reorganising stuff to use a slab
	system instead of pure AVL, since it proved to give too much
	overhead.

	work very well so I've disabled it for now.

	execution of binaries where the .data and .bss sections was not
	right at each other.

2000-05-14  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Re-implemented the idle thread, since we decided it would be
	useful.

2000-05-10  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Significant bug fixes. Support for blocking on mailbox_send
	(even though it doesn't seem to be fully working). Better mutex
	thread creation system and on the whole a lot more stable system.
 
2000-04-27  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Removed the video mode code, since GRUB doesn't support it in
	the official version yet, and won't for a while...

2000-04-11  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Removed the non-inlines memory_* functions, since they were a
	pain in the arse to maintain, and didn't offer significant gain.

2000-04-09  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/thread.c (thread_create): Fixed a fatal bug which made the
	copying of the stack totally nonfunctional.

	far as giving the process access to the ports.

2000-03-25  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Oh, well. Since storm 0.4.0 is getting delayed, we've decided to
	release the current code base as 0.3.99. This should be considered
	some kind of beta.
