	actually used from thread_control...

2000-08-17  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory.c (memory_deallocate): Changed this function to take
	a double pointer argument instead of a page number.

2000-08-14  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/thread.c (thread_create): Made the function create unique
	copies of the lowest page table, so that threads are a little more

	little earlier if the input data is bad.

	* generic/mailbox.c (mailbox_receive): Re-added the check for the
	thread ID, so that you can not do a receive on someone else's
	mailbox. The reason I commented it out was a long story, but it
	should really be there, due to several causes.

2000-07-28  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* makefile.template: Added an $Id: changelog,v 1.17 2000/07/30

	If)

2000-07-23  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

2000-07-22  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* include/storm/return_values.h: Removed the stupid error codes I

	port_free_all function.

2000-07-18  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory.c: Fixed memory allocation for processes. Yahoo!

2000-07-17  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

2000-07-10  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/memory_global.c: Started reorganising stuff to use a slab
	system instead of pure AVL, since it proved to give too much
	overhead.

	work very well so I've disabled it for now.

	right at each other.

2000-05-14  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Re-implemented the idle thread, since we decided it would be
	useful.

2000-05-10  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Significant bug fixes. Support for blocking on mailbox_send
	(even though it doesn't seem to be fully working). Better mutex
	thread creation system and on the whole a lot more stable system.
 
2000-04-27  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Removed the video mode code, since GRUB doesn't support it in
	the official version yet, and won't for a while...

2000-04-11  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Removed the non-inlines memory_* functions, since they were a
	pain in the arse to maintain, and didn't offer significant gain.

2000-04-09  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* ia32/thread.c (thread_create): Fixed a fatal bug which made the
	copying of the stack totally nonfunctional.

	far as giving the process access to the ports.

2000-03-25  Per Lundberg  <plundis@chaosdev.org>

	* Oh, well. Since storm 0.4.0 is getting delayed, we've decided to
	release the current code base as 0.3.99. This should be considered
	some kind of beta.
