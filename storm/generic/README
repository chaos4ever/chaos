======

All CPU generic code are to be put here. Please, be very aware that
the code here *must* run on different endian-size systems, so be
careful with what you put here.

(Right now, far too much is put in the ia32 subdirectory. We intend to
change this very soon. If you like, you could do it and send us a
patch.)
